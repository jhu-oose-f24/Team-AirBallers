## Iteration 1 - Retrospective

In iteration 1, we set up the base scaffolding: created the next.js frontend and node+express backend. We weren't concerned with saving user data (no integration with MongoDB yet), but made sure users could generate and view an item of clothing given a simple/general prompt.

One challenge we had was learning to use the server benefits of next.js, so we opted for a separate backend server using express routes to connect with the client while we familiarized ourselves with next.js.

This iteration we will merge the frontend and backend into one project, taking advantage of next.js api and routing features, as well as defining the types and js classes to be used (established in UML). At this point we will also flesh out and integrate a garment editor into the app flow.
