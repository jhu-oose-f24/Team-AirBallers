## Iteration 3 - Retrospective

For iteration 3, a big goal of ours was to implement pants generation for the image and prompt generator. Additionally, we aimed to agree on a consistent style for organizing the data in MongoDB, specifically for the collections feature. We also aimed to fix certain bugs and issues with generating the garment and making the README more clear for users. 

One challenge we experienced last iteration is agreeing on a json schema to save each garment, allowing the edit feature to function properly. Additionally, we are still dealing with the issue that when editing, subsequent generations can vary highly, causing uneccesary details to be added to the garment. Overall, we hope to fix these issues in iteration 4.

For iteration 4, we aim to make the UI look prettier, especially with the edit feature and collections feature. We also aim to add a login feature, specifically using Google Auth Library. Finally, a big goal of ours is to finalize on the json schema we want to use for each garment and how they are saved in clusters in the database.
