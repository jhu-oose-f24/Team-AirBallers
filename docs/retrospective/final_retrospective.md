# Iteration 5 - Final Retrospective

For this last iteration, the main efforts went towards finalizing the implementation for the garment edit flow, as well as operations involving organizing and modifying garments and the collections they're in. A lot of work went into integrating frontend features with the APIs they're associated with.

Looking back through all iterations, we fortunately never needed to drastically modify must-have features. We didn't, however, have the time to dedicate to nice-to-have features. A major challenge we overcame along the way was developing a pipeline that integrated an interactive garment editor. 

In hindsight, we should have discussed the detailed features earlier on than we did, to be on the same page when it comes to implementing them. We also think our debugging would've benefitted from unit testing of the main generator and object classes.
