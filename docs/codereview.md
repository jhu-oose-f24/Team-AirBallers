Test: The code did not use automated tests. Most testing was done manually, a lot of it was following the code logic until the promblematic code was discovered. Automated testing would have made the debugging proccess a lot easier. 

Naming: The naming covention was clear and did a good job of indicating what the varible, class, and functions were doing. Overall the naming was well done and made the code very readable. 

Comments: Comments are fairly clear and useful. Class functions have documentation preceedings the class that explain what the params are, what the class returns and potential errors that can be thrown. 

Style: The codebase followed good programming practices. Everything is clear and organized. The codebase is readable and easy to navigate.

Documentation: There is very clear and detailed documentation on how to run the code.
