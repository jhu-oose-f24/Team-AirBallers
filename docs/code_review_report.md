Backend:
Design: The backend pipeline is well-designed and follows a serialized path of prompting to generate both the garment image and the garment specs. Additionally, the prompting correctly classifies the user prompt, which then pipelines into the garment specs generation which then pipelines into generatin the garment image. This allows the user to edit the garment by changing certain specs in the edit feature, allowing for a new garment generation. Additionally, this design allows efficient saving of the garment into a garment collection with its respective specs to view. Additionally, each generator and part of the pipeline follows the single-responsibility principle very closely, only being assigned one task to do and accomplish. This also goes for the open-closed principle where each method is modified, not changed and the interface segregation principle with the abstraction of garments and generators. Additionally, the code follows good error handling principles and implementations can use multiple error handlers. The code also accurately and efficiently models the relationships between User, Collection, and Garment. As we can see in schema.prisma, each of the Models, the Generator, and the Datasource are all correctly implemented. That is, all the necessary components like embedded types, scalar types, and more are in the models.

Complexity: Overall, the backend is very simple and does not need further simplification as most of it is prompt engineering and using the OpenAI and Fal APIs, while using files for each spec and garment needed to be implemented. Additionally, a developer would very easily be able to understand the pipeline especially with all the naming conventions, documentations, and comments within each file. I believe that developers should be able to easily determine what each model does, what the relationships are between each other, and the general structure of the app just from the schema page.

Test: The code did not use automated tests. Most testing was done manually, a lot of it was following the code logic until the promblematic code was discovered. Automated testing would have made the debugging proccess a lot easier. 

Naming: The naming covention was clear and did a good job of indicating what the varible, class, and functions were doing. Overall the naming was well done and made the code very readable. The names of the models such as Collection, Garment, GarmentType, User and Account are all clear on what they are and how they function. The naming conventions for all the models are generally consistent and accurate.

Comments: Comments are fairly clear and useful. Class functions have documentation preceedings the class that explain what the params are, what the class returns and potential errors that can be thrown.

Style: The codebase followed good programming practices. Everything is clear and organized. The codebase is readable and easy to navigate. The style used for the Schemas is consistent and adheres to Prismaâ€™s style conventions. All the field types, defaults, and relationships use the same case and therefore shows uniformity.

Documentation: There is very clear and detailed documentation on how to run the code.
