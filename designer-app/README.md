This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Node.js and a Node.js Manager (if not already installed)

1. Before running the project, ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) or install it using Node Version Manager or Homebrew

2. Install project dependencies
Once Node.js is installed, navigate to the project directory and install the required packages using one of the following package managers:

If you prefer npm (default with Node.js):

```bash
npm install
# or 
yarn install
# or 
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
