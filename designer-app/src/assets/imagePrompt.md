Generate a clean product-style image of the garment with the following specifications:

1. GARMENT FOCUS:
   - The garment should be the only subject in the image
   - Display the complete garment from top to bottom without any cropping
   - Center the garment in the frame
   - Show the garment as if on an invisible mannequin (3D ghost mannequin effect)

2. BACKGROUND:
   - Use a solid, contrasting background color that complements the garment
   - For light-colored garments, use a medium to dark gray background
   - For dark-colored garments, use a light gray or off-white background

3. LIGHTING:
   - Employ even, professional studio-style lighting
   - Minimize harsh shadows
   - Ensure all details and textures are clearly visible

4. COMPOSITION:
   - Maintain a straight, front-facing view
   - Include a small amount of padding around the garment
   - Keep the garment proportions natural and realistic
   - Aspect ratio should be appropriate for the garment type (square for shirts, portrait for pants)

5. QUALITY:
   - Render the garment with high detail and clarity
   - Ensure fabric textures and patterns are distinct
   - Make all design elements, seams, and features clearly visible

Do not include:
- No human models or mannequins
- No props or accessories
- No decorative elements or watermarks
- No shadows that might obscure garment details
- No artistic effects or filters

The final image should look like a professional e-commerce product photograph, suitable for a designer clothing website.
